Simple WebGl Program that renders a cubemap scene with some loaded 2D textures, a hierarchical model, a parameterized surface, and phong lighting. 

You can adjust the camera rotation by holding and clicking the primary mouse button. 

NOTE: I attempted to get a loaded JSON file to work. but to no avail. I'm not really sure what I should do.
