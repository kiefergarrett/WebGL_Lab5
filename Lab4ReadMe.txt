Lab4

Simple WebGl Program that renders a cube, cyllinder, and sphere into a scene. An aditional cube is rendered to give a better perspective on the depth of the 
object as it moves within the scene. You can move the light around the scene with w,a,s,d,e, and q as well as rotate the object with built in 
html buttons. The objects are set up in a 3 tiered hierarchical fasion per the lab requirements. You can adjust  the hierarchy level with 
the built in html buttons. 

You can also adjust the camera's pitch, yaw, and roll with P/p, Y/y, R/r (respectively).

NOTE: I attempted to get a loaded JSON file to work. but to no avail. I'm not really sure what I should do.
